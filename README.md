# 🛒 Apriori Algorithm — Demo & Assignment

This repository contains a complete educational demonstration of the **Apriori algorithm**, including:

- A clean implementation of Apriori (`apriori.py`)
- A Streamlit-based interactive demo (`streamlit_app.py`)
- Two market-basket datasets (sparse and dense)
- A hands-on assignment for students (`assignment_full.md`)

This repo is suitable for:

- Teaching Apriori in university courses  
- Demonstrating association-rule mining  
- Showing the impact of support thresholds  
- Comparing sparse vs dense datasets  
- Running simple experiments and generating rules
